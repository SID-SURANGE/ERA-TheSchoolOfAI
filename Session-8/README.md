<h3><i><b>Analysis of CODE7</b></i></h2>
<I>

---


**Target:**
1.   Improve Model accuracy to reach stable test accuracy over 99.4
2.   Use LR Scheduler to add different learning rates to each Epoch.
3.   Add augmentation to make model learn different test data.
3.   Change the architecture to make it more complex.

**Results:**
1.   Parameters: 7592
2.   Best Train Acc: 98.90(last epoch)
3.   Best Test Acc: 99.47(12th epoch) / 99.45(13th epoch) / 99.41(14th epoch) / 99.44(15th epoch)
4.   Difference : No overfitting
5.   Epoch - 15

**Analysis:**
1.   Model gives a consistent test accuracy above 99.40 which seems to be a good sign.
2.   We see a bit of underfitting of the model as test score is high.
