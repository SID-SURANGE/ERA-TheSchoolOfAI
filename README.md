### **Repo Usage details**
<hr/>
Below are the details for using the code<br />

- Clone the repository
- Using in Local -
    1. Check if system has dedicated graphics card to support GPU training
    2. Verify python > 3.9 environment exist with support for Jupyter notebook, Pytorch
    3. If all exists, open the notebook and run the cells in order
- Using in Colab -
    1. Load the .ipynb file into colab, the model.py and utils.py also
    2. Connect the colab to a GPU enabled runtime
    3. Now just run the notebook and play around
