<h3><i><b>Analysis of CODE3</b></i></h2>
<I>

---

**Target:**
1.   Training the model under **less iterations** and restructuring the architecture for **less trainiable parameters** or complexity.


**Results:**
1.   Parameters: 10546
2.   Best Train Acc: 98.99(15th epoch)
3.   Best Test Acc: 98.84(in 15 th epoch)
4.   Difference : More train accuracy - Small overfit scenario
5.   Epoch - 15


**Analysis:**
1.   Model looks a bit overfit.
2.   Architecture looks simple overall and can be improved upon to attain good accuracy and prevent overfitting.
