**Target:**

1.   Introduce **Dropout** to decrease overfitting.
2.   Apply different dropout rates as per kernels in each conv layer.

**Results:**

1.   Parameters: 6288
2.   Best Train Acc: 99.22
3.   Best Test Acc: 99.34
4.   Difference : More test accuracy
5.   Epoch - 15

**Analysis:**


1.   Model seems to be stable with no overfitting.
2.   Model accuracy must be tuned by trying different learning rates or changing architecture with more feature extractors.
