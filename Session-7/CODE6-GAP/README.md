**Target:**
1.   Improve Model accuracy to reach stable test accuracy over 99.4
2.   Added GAP to remove the last layer

**Results:**
1.   Parameters: 5328
2.   Best Train Acc: 99.19(last Epoch)
3.   Best Test Acc: 99.22(last epoch)
4.   Difference : No overfitting
5.   Epoch - 15

**Analysis:**
1.   Model test accuracy is stuck around 99.20 which has to be further improved using adding augumentation
