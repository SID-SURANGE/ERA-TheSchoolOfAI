**Target:**

1.   Introduce **Batch Normalization** to increase model's efficiency and help it to converge faster.
Also it provides some regularization.

**Results:**

1.   Parameters: 6288
2.   Best Train Acc: 99.69(last epoch)
3.   Best Test Acc: 99.20(last epoch)
4.   Difference : More train accuracy
5.   Epoch - 15

**Analysis:**


1.   Model again overfits as compared to the last model
2.   Need to introduce dropout to bridge the gap between the train and test accuracy
